	<blockquote>
	<p>"I have always been an outcast. An impostor and a charlatan. A complete bastard. I have never felt comfortable in my own skin. And yet this state of mind has been imposed on me, I feel, not due to some internal defect, but rather forged out of the unfortunate confines of the communities I have sought to mold into. I am a disturbed man. A grotesque human begin. I do terrible things. And then cast them off as mere fantasy. What is more dreadful than appalling action is a mind riddled with anxiety and fear. And this unease transmutes into guilt. Guilt about being seen, about being heard. Given a choice, I would hover amongst the darkest shadows and crawl seamlessly through crowds unnoticed. And so my life is also one that is a constant struggle inflicted with the burden of passing each day inconspicuously whilst trying to maintain relationships within the limitations of “civilized” society. I wish I were born another creature. Like a rat or a slug. It would suit me, or better yet, a being with little consciousness, like bacteria or some plant.</p>
	<p>I think the trouble started in my childhood. Yes, yes.. I was not yet sixteen, when I first swallowed those pills. There were eighty-two of them in total. Eighty-two. I had sat on the bathroom tiles and counted them meticulously. Held the pills in my palm and clenched my fist, letting them flow through. Picked the fallen bits and consumed them in three gulps. The idea had formed as a mere fledgling of a speculation, a morsel of a thought. It lay there unsheathed in the bottom rungs of my mind. Tossing and whirling, gesticulating till it began to ossify into something concrete. And the pills. How fastidious I had been in amassing them. I had escaped on several occasions, furtively visiting numerous pharmacies in order to acquire them over several protracted weeks..."</p>

	<p>"I once saw a man who had hung himself. It was my father. He had finally found a purpose for the disused sisal that lay abandoned in the shed for years. I was not yet twelve. I had been playing with my younger neighbor, Hamid, in the fields. Mother had told us not to play there since we were to ruin the potatoes. We played in any case. It was a Saturday. I remember the day, but I don't remember the exact date. I remember it was a Saturday, because we weren't in school that day. Because on Sunday we would visit our grandmothers grave, and I don't recall going to the graveyard that morning. There was a scream from the barn. We had both stopped dead in our tracks. It had immediately struck me as something unworldly. That scream will remain embedded in my memory for my entire life. The source of this heartwrenching howl I attributed to my mother, even though a bystander may not have been able to associate the sound to that of a human being.</p>
	<p>Perhaps, she had been saying something afterwards, but the initial cry had caught me off-guard, so that I couldn't consciously register any sound afterwards. I remember that scream; it was the scream of an animal. Such as when you are slaughtering a goat and it wails its final blubbering bawl as the blade makes that first incision. It was that kind of scream. And so, for a split second I had believed that an animal was being massacred. The fear it had induced in me had immediately torn away at my heart and I could feel an extra load begin to weigh down on it. That extra weight has been growing heavier ever since..."</p>

	<p>"When one of my friends came to the studio and looked at the pieces, he commented that they were quite good, but I felt a great disdain for him at that moment. I thought he didn't understand what I was doing. That he could never understand. I didn't want to hear that it was good. What I wanted was to bring the viewer down to their knees and begin to weep. To see the beauty of their whole lives scan in front of their faces. To say to themselves, now that I have seen this, there is nothing else left to see, to feel. Nobody would ever appreciate the art that I was making, no matter what they said it would never be enough for me. I was never satisfied with my work. There was always something lacking. The colors did not come out the way I had envisioned or the painting did not express the feelings I was trying to evoke. I was in pursuit of something that was theoretically unattainable.</p>
	<p> At the exhibition I lingered in a corner meekly observing all who would pass by my section. I thought about going and speaking to them. To explain to them what I was trying to show, so that they could see the meaning behind the paintings, but I stayed at the back just observing their expressions. There weren't too many people at the exhibition. An old lady came and lowered her glasses slightly as she looked at each of my paintings. She seemed to show some interest. A girl who must have been in her early twenties, dressed in jeans and a tshirt came by. She was chewing gum and didn't spend more than a few seconds on each painting before she went away. Most of the people just crossed by and did not even stop to look at the paintings. It seemed as if they wanted to walk towards the end of the exhibition and leave, that they had somehow been forced to be there and wanted to get it over with. Two middle aged men wearing starched up shalwar kameez's came and stopped by my paintings. One of them whispered to the other pointing at one corner of a painting and they both started to laugh..."</p>

	<p>"I will make poetry today, he thought. Real poetry. Should he write about that leaf he saw on the window sill? It had floated gently in the air and come to settle there with some vigour. It meant that autmun was in the air. But was it really autumn? It was a dried leaf. He hadn't seen a leaf in a while. Perhaps it had been a few months. Maybe more. Or had he seen one and hadn't taken notice of it? The sky was bleak. Was it the dust and smog or were there genuine clouds out there? He didn't know any more. He couldn't be bothered to find out.</p>
    <p>'I will write a sonnet!' he said aloud, for my lover. This lover he alluded to, he had only seen once, and that was many years ago. Would he be able to muster enough material from that one sole meeting. He didn't remember her name. He remembered the face. The lips and the hair. Her eyes. But the name escaped him. Did he remember the face? Or was it just any face that his imagination has conjured up? No, he was sure he remembered it. It was a sweet face. It had a warmth to it. She had her blonde hair in a pony tail. Her lips were full of life. And her eyes, they were a light colour he imagined. She was from Estonia. He had held her hand while she crossed over the bridge, and they had shared a bit of a smile. But that was the end of it. No, it will be too sappy to write a sonnet.</p> 
	<p> I will make poetry if it's the last thing I do, and considering that his rations were coming to an end it might well be the last thing he did. I will write a short poem about the sun, he thought..."</p>

Someone was going to come for him. They were waiting for just the right moment, and then they would close in. He lay there on the ground waiting for the footsteps to resume, but nothing stirred. He must have stayed motionless for at least ten minutes and as he lifted his head, there was a sound. A clicking sound. Coming from the window. He quietly made his way to the window, cautiously taking each step so that his steps would not be heard,and yet the soft sound of his foot hitting the ground sent shockwaves in his ears and he could not bare it. The clicking resumed. He inspected the source, it seemed to be coming from within the wall right next to the window, but he was not too sure..."</p>

He felt dead inside. He felt like he must leave this place. It was a terrrible state to be in. A pergutory. Everyone was out of their minds here. Even the nurses seemed mad to him. He must leave this place, as it was not a place where a human being could survive. This place, with it's unbearable, cold, dark and deathly wait. There was always the wait. Waiting for the next meal, waiting for the medication, and waiting for his treatment. If he wanted to talk to the doctor they would make him wait, and he would stand outside the door, without moving sometimes for upto three or four hours, till he felt that he was positively going to collapse from the anticipation. There was no real external stimuli. There was one chess set that they kept, but unfortunately no one else had a clue of how to play and he could not indulge in even this simple pleasure. So he sat staring out the window, into the dreary mounds and the gray sky. Everything had lost its color in this place. He thought that perhaps he had gone color blind, for even the food seemed as though it was gray..."</p>

Who could it be from? He quickly got up from his chair and walked to the far end of the room, to the kitchennete and began to prepare some coffee. This was an occasion almost to celebrate, that is how excited he became about the email. As he waited for the water to boil, he began pacing up and down in front of the sink, with one hand on his chin, contemplating who the sender of the email could be. Would it be a distant relative, or perhaps an old friend? It might even be an ex-girlfriend he thought to himself. What a delightful surprise to receive an email on a Friday. Perhaps it was someone asking him if he would like to a party in the evening? No, no, he must not get carried away. No one had invited him out for years, and there was no reason to do so all of a sudden. Who would ask him now? Or would it be? It wasn't out of the realm of possibility. If they were to ask him out now he would of course have to refuse. It was simply out of the question, he would say. It was not possible, he would say..."</p>

In my mind I sing a tune and it comes out as a light murmur. And now the sun is already setting. There is a donkey tied to a pole lying on the ground on its belly, and waving its tail about to keep the flies away. A woman sits on a chair close to a group of boys playing cricket. She is knitting away a scarf of some sort. Knitting seems like it should calm your nerves. She looks moderately calm and yet there is a slight twitch in her fingers that betrays some sort of restlessness. I get the feeling that if her knitting equipment was taken away from her she wouldn’t really know what to do with her fingers. They would be a useless extension of a useless limb, controlled by a useless mind..."</p>

	<p>"...He enters and it is a large mostly empty room with a table in the center of the room where an old man, clean shaven and with ruffled hair is seated. He goes to the table, each step echoing loudly across the chamber.</p>
	<p></p>
	<p>'I see you have come here for your application to be considered a human.'</p>
	<p></p>
	<p>'Yes.'</p>
	<p></p>
	<p>'Take a seat.'</p>
	<p></p>
	<p>The lamp points towards his face, so that he has to squint and can only see the light and not the face of the old man clearly.</p>
	<p></p>
	<p>'Well I have gone through your application, and made a decision.'</p>
	<p></p>
	<p>'You have lived a sorry life till now. Not much to be considered.'</p>
	<p></p>
	<p>'But father, I have done all to please you. In fact I have always lived my life in such a way, so that you could be proud of me.. but it seems as though no matter what I have done you will never be proud.'</p>
	<p></p>
	<p>'Nonsense, I am not your father!'</p>
	<p></p>
	<p>'I have worked hard all my life. You can never be pleased with the way I am. You have never accepted me.'</p>
	<p></p>
	<p>'Yours has been a most despicable existence, neither providing hope, nor sensing any despair for your fellow human beings.'</p>
	<p></p>
	<p>'But I tried! his lips begin to quiver. I have lived a good life.'</p>
	<p></p>
	<p>'You have only ever cared about yourself. Never did you pay attention to anyone but yourself.'</p>
	<p></p>
	<p>Daud curls up on the ground, burying his face in his knees and covers his ears from the sounds and sheltering his eyes.</p>
	<p></p>
	<p>'I hereby relieve you of all your former duties. You are no longer fit to be a human being.'</p>
	<p></p>
	<p>And with that he stamps the application with a big block, the sound of which echoes across the chamber.</p>

	<p> "She walked to the well and started pumping out some water in a bucket. She heard a cry come from the well and stopped pumping.‘Save me.’ it said in a soft voice. ‘Save me.’ And she was rather surprised by this shrill distant voice. She peered down the well but her eyes in their old age were not as sharp as they had once been and she only saw darkness. ‘Save me’ the voice said again, and she decided that she would go down the well. She took off her slippers and using all her might, climbed over the wall and started to go down the ladder. With each step it got cooler and the sounds from the outside world were replaced by a dull monotonous wind that sweeped from within to the outside. She kept stopping after every few rungs to catch her breath and look down but the well was quite deep. She decided to pause for a few minutes. Her eyes attuned to the atmosphere and now she could make out her surroundings. The well had become quite wide and it was made of hard stone all around. It glimmered at this depth and gave off a blue shine. She didn’t remember ever having climbed down the well, but she thought that she must have, since the memory of these stones were etched in her mind."</p>

	<p> "Yesterday, I overdosed by ingesting thirty Zopiclone 7.5 mg sleeping pills with some alcohol. I drank three bottles of beer, and had decided not to eat the entire day so that the pills could be easily absorbed into my body. I began to feel drowsy and then I thought about covering my head with a plastic bag and tied it with a shoelace, since the chance of a successful suicide nearly doubles this way, I had read somewhere. But the oxygen from the hermetic bag began to suffocate me while I was still quite cognizant and the urge to breathe overpowered my mind so that while gasping for breath, I was forced to remove the bag. I perhaps should have timed it better so that it was a larger bag and I had enough oxygen to last me before I fell unconscious. What went through my mind is difficult to say. There was a bit of panic. Should I call someone perhaps? I thought it better just to fall into a deep sleep..."

	<p> "Yes... yes, that is correct. The boy was found right there, in the playground, in front of our house. But, I had nothing to do with his death. May I remind you that he was found not by me, but by Ayesha, the daughter of Abdul Karim who lives next door, while she was putting the clothes out to dry in the early morning. He had hung himself with a rope tied to the swings; a most pitiful way to die. Her screams had echoed across the courtyard. I still remember the scene quite vividly. The morning fog had yet to settle as I scrambled out and there the boy hung. His eyes were popping out his distended blue face, as though Shaitan himself had gripped his forsaken soul and embodied him. And even though the villagers had begun to gather, there was a lingering seclusion that encompassed the atmosphere."

	<blockquote> 
	<p> "I make my way into the condensed congested room, the furniture laced with concoctions of all kinds of various crumbs, dirt and grime. I have entered the lodgings of that maniac, Sherlock Holmes. On the walls are scattered hysterical writings in ink, and bits of paper are glued to the ceiling, depicting equations of geometry befitting knowledge of secondary school education. The curtains are drawn and only a few rays of the midday sun seep through, which creates an even gloomier ambiance as specks of dust glimmer in the thickened atmosphere. On the far end of the blurred room, his arm chair faces towards a wall, and a cloud of smoke emerges from the other side. I clear my throat so as to make my presence known, but nothing stirs. He is coiled up in a fetal position I imagine, so that he is not visible from where I am standing.</p>
	<p></p>
	<p>'Sherlock..'</p>
	<p></p>
	<p>I hear some papers shuffle. I take a few steps closer. There is no movement. Then all of a sudden, in a rage of fury, the man jerks upwards from behind his chair, steps on the cushion and jumping over, dashes towards me and grabs me by the collar.</p>
	<p></p>
	<p>'Do you know what this is?'</p>
    <p></p>	
	<p>There is a maddening look in his eyes, which is transfixed on my mouth, as if he is anticipating the words that I am about to say. His eyebrows are slightly raised, and his mouth open in an 'O' shape as if he is sounding the word 'Nooo' in his head. I am slightly taken aback and my eyes wander down. There, right next to his cheek, in his right hand he holds a stick.</p>
	<p></p>
	<p>'Uhh, no.'</p>
	<p></p>
    <p>And as I say it, he mimics the word simultaneously, slowly and deliberately, bobbing his head up and down.</p>
	<p></p>
	<p>'Allow me to elucidate the situation then, Dr. Watson.'</p>
	<p></p>
	<p>I am not a doctor, I have told him this countless times. Yet, he insists on calling me doctor. I am yet a graduate student in training, and have taken up, for my thesis a case-study of the neurotic mind..."</p>

	<blockquote> 
	<p>"When one of my friends came to the studio and looked at the pieces, he commented that they were quite good, but I felt a great disdain for him at that moment. I thought he didn't understand what I was doing. That he could never understand. I didn't want to hear that it was good. What I wanted was to bring the viewer down to their knees and begin to weep. To see the beauty of their whole lives scan in front of their faces. To say to themselves, now that I have seen this, there is nothing else left to see, to feel. Nobody would ever appreciate the art that I was making, no matter what they said it would never be enough for me. I was never satisfied with my work. There was always something lacking. The colors did not with my work. There was always something lacking. The colors did not come out the way I had envisioned or the painting did not express the feelings I was trying to evoke. I was in pursuit of something that was theoretically unattainable.</p>
	<p> At the exhibition I lingered in a corner meekly observing all who would pass by my section. I thought about going and speaking to them. To explain to them what I was trying to show, so that they could see the meaning behind the paintings, but I stayed at the back just observing their expressions. There weren't too many people at the exhibition. An old lady came and lowered her glasses slightly as she looked at each of my paintings. She seemed to show some interest. A girl who must have been in her early twenties, dressed in jeans and a tshirt came by. She was chewing gum and didn't spend more than a few seconds on each painting before she went away. Most of the people just crossed by and did not even stop to look at the paintings. It seemed as if they wanted to walk towards the end of the exhibition and leave, that they had somehow been forced to be there and wanted to get it over with. Two middle aged men wearing starched up shalwar kameez's came with. Two middle aged men wearing starched up shalwar kameez's came and stopped by my paintings. One of them whispered to the other pointing at one corner of a painting and they both started to laugh."<p>

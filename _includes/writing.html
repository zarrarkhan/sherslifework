	<blockquote> 
	<p>"When one of my friends came to the studio and looked at the pieces, he commented that they were quite good, but I felt a great disdain for him at that moment. I thought he didn't understand what I was doing. That he could never understand. I didn't want to hear that it was good. What I wanted was to bring the viewer down to their knees and begin to weep. To see the beauty of their whole lives scan in front of their faces. To say to themselves, now that I have seen this, there is nothing else left to see, to feel. Nobody would ever appreciate the art that I was making, no matter what they said it would never be enough for me. I was never satisfied with my work. There was always something lacking. The colors did not with my work. There was always something lacking. The colors did not come out the way I had envisioned or the painting did not express the feelings I was trying to evoke. I was in pursuit of something that was theoretically unattainable.</p>
	<p> At the exhibition I lingered in a corner meekly observing all who would pass by my section. I thought about going and speaking to them. To explain to them what I was trying to show, so that they could see the meaning behind the paintings, but I stayed at the back just observing their expressions. There weren't too many people at the exhibition. An old lady came and lowered her glasses slightly as she looked at each of my paintings. She seemed to show some interest. A girl who must have been in her early twenties, dressed in jeans and a tshirt came by. She was chewing gum and didn't spend more than a few seconds on each painting before she went away. Most of the people just crossed by and did not even stop to look at the paintings. It seemed as if they wanted to walk towards the end of the exhibition and leave, that they had somehow been forced to be there and wanted to get it over with. Two middle aged men wearing starched up shalwar kameez's came and stopped by my paintings. One of them whispered to the other pointing at one corner of a painting and they both started to laugh."</p>

	<blockquote> 
	<p>"I once saw a man who had hung himself. It was my father. He had finally found a purpose for the disused sisal that lay abandoned in the shed for years. I was not yet twelve. I had been playing with my younger neighbor, Hamid, in the fields. Mother had told us not to play there since we were to ruin the potatoes. We played in any case. It was a Saturday. I remember the day, but I don't remember the exact date. I remember it was a Saturday, because we weren't in school that day. Because on Sunday we would visit our grandmothers grave, and I don't recall going to the graveyard that morning. There was a scream from the barn. We had both stopped dead in our tracks. It had immediately struck me as something unworldly. That scream will remain embedded in my memory for my entire life. The source of this heartwrenching howl I attributed to my mother, even though a bystander may not have been able to associate the sound to that of a human being.</p>
	<p>Perhaps, she had been saying something afterwards, but the initial cry had caught me off-guard, so that I couldn't consciously register any sound afterwards. I remember that scream; it was the scream of an animal. Such as when you are slaughtering a goat and it wails its final blubbering bawl as the blade makes that first incision. It was that kind of scream. And so, for a split second I had believed that an animal was being massacred. The fear it had induced in me had immediately torn away at my heart and I could feel an extra load begin to weigh down on it. That extra weight has been growing heavier ever since."</p>

	<blockquote>
	<p>"I have always been an outcast. An impostor and a charlatan. A complete bastard. I have never felt comfortable in my own skin. And yet this state of mind has been imposed on me, I feel, not due to some internal defect, but rather forged out of the unfortunate confines of the communities I have sought to mold into. I am a disturbed man. A grotesque human begin. I do terrible things. And then cast them off as mere fantasy. What is more dreadful than appalling action is a mind riddled with anxiety and fear. And this unease transmutes into guilt. Guilt about being seen, about being heard. Given a choice, I would hover amongst the darkest shadows and crawl seamlessly through crowds unnoticed. And so my life is also one that is a constant struggle inflicted with the burden of passing each day inconspicuously whilst trying to maintain relationships within the limitations of “civilized” society. I wish I were born another creature. Like a rat or a slug. It would suit me, or better yet, a being with little consciousness, like bacteria or some plant.</p>
	<p>I think the trouble started in my childhood. Yes, yes.. I was not yet sixteen, when I first swallowed those pills. There were eighty-two of them in total. Eighty-two. I had sat on the bathroom tiles and counted them meticulously. Held the pills in my palm and clenched my fist, letting them flow through. Picked the fallen bits and consumed them in three gulps. The idea had formed as a mere fledgling of a speculation, a morsel of a thought. It lay there unsheathed in the bottom rungs of my mind. Tossing and whirling, gesticulating till it began to ossify into something concrete. And the pills. How fastidious I had been in amassing them. I had escaped on several occasions, furtively visiting numerous pharmacies in order to acquire them over several protracted weeks."</p>
